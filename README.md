# Exploratory-data-analysis-Assign1
All plots and scripts for assignment 1 of the Coursera course Exploratory data analysis

Hi,

Since I am from Holland, the language I use on my pc is Dutch. The labels of the days for various plots are in Dutch.

* do = Thursday (Dutch: donderdag)
* vr = Friday (Dutch: vrijdag)
* za = Saturday (Dutch: zaterdag)
